<p class="tab"> Bob Hoover is perhaps most famous for his airshow routines. Pictured above is Bob's famous shrike commander. His most notable routine involved taking this business aircraft through rolls, loops, and other aerobatic manuevres. For his grand finale, Bob would shut both engines down and execute a loop followed by an 8 point hesitation roll. Afterwards, he would land the aircraft one wheel at a time and use the remaining energy to roll the aircraft back to the parking area without restarting either engine! 
Bob was also known for pouring himself a cup of tea using gravity while performing a 1G barrel roll.
